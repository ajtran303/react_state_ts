Tutorial for stateful React with Typescript. 

<!-- Includes lesson plan, learning objectives, activities, checks for understanding. -->

## Local Install

### Prerequisites

You must have `node` installed, the recommended version is 14.18+. Check your node version with:

```bash
$ node -v
```

### Local Installation

Fork and clone this repo: ([Fork Link](https://github.com/ajtran303/react_state_ts/fork)).

```bash
$ cd react_state_ts
```

Install the project dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start the development server

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

The console will be "parked" while running the server. The webapp will now be served at on [localhost at port 5173](http://localhost:5173/).

There are some helpful keyboard commands to know when focused in the terminal during this time. You will see them in the console output:

```
  VITE v4.3.9  ready in 1248 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help

  Shortcuts
  press r to restart the server
  press u to show server url
  press o to open in browser
  press c to clear console
  press q to quit
```

The commands I find most helpful are `o` to open the app in the browser and `q` to stop the server.
